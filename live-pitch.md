Good morning/evening judges, organizers and mentors. My name is Jason Dsouza, and I'm here with my teammate Arsalaan. Our third teammate, Sarthak, sends his apologies for not being able to be with us today, since he's in dead-centre in exam season. 

So the two of us will represent our team CAD-TOD, where we help increase an organization's donations footprint through tangible and organic methods.
The non-profit that we've partnered with this hackathon is Control Alt Delete. Their mission is to facilitate a new lease of life to victims of domestic violence & abuse arond the Arizona area.

Okay, so like most non-profits new to the scenes, our organization struggled with getting donors. But we've gone one step further to suggest that they also struggle with retaining those donors. If you actually have a look at the progression report of any non-profit, this is not uncommon. This happens more than one realizes. 

In fact, a couple of years ago according to a research paper written in Canada, nearly 1 out of 3, that's one-third, of Canadians are hesistant to donate to a non-profit.

Why? Well, we can think of 2 reasons.

One, there are hundreds of scammy non-profits on the market today which makes it difficult for the average user to filter out genuine NPOs from the rest. The second, and we feel that this is the actual reason, is that people don't really understand the impact that ther donations will have on the organization. Many people feel that they can donate only, say, $10 but how will the organization benefit from this? These are questions that run through a person's mind. What they don't realize is that even $10 dollars is really enough to help out a single person. In fact, our NPO goes to say that just $12.28 helps save one life. So it's not that donors have to spend say hundreds of dollars to help out.

Which brings me to our solution. If you wanted to summarize our entire solution that we discuss in the next few minutes, in just one sentence, it's that we want to build trust between our NPO and a potential donor. So, how do we do this?

Well, we focus our efforts on the one place where every single potential donor will spend most of their time on. This is the website. It's a large playing ground that, if done right, we can tip a person's decision to donate in our favour.

Let me illustrate a simple decision tree that explains my point. The very fact that a person visits the website indicates 50% chance of them from donating. They're already interested, somewhat vaguely, in the mission, and if we can somehow show them the real problem and mission of our organization, and show them the impact that can make with a donation, this 50% turns into a greater than 85% chance.

And this is exactly what we're trying to do. 
Introducing TOD, Tangible and Organic donations.

In the first part, the tangible, we hope to further cement in the idea of the organization's mission as well as the problem that they're trying to solve, and giving them the right statistics which will make a donor more likely a positive decision in our favour. And in this first point, UI matters. A website reflects like the soul of the organization. You cannot have a boring and dead-looking site, because that's going to already put in the mind of the user that this organization is boring. It happens subconsioucly no matter how much we try to deny this. 

This approach provides transparency to a potential donor, which leads to wise spending of donations, which eventually spurs more donations. In this phase, trust is extremely important.

Okay, now moving on the second part, the organic. Once we've got a donor, it's all not said and done. If you can't convince a donor of their impact at this point when they've donated, you risk losing them from ever donating again. And this is not hard work. In fact, it's much easier to convince a donor to donate again than it is trying to convince a completely different invidual to your cause. Your donor is already convinced, you just need to give them a slight nudge. 
The smart way is to maintain that relationship with the donor.

How do we do this?

Well, by showing donors the real impact their money has had (and not just locked away forever in a black box never to be seen again)

Our solutions to this is to provide an interactive dashboard for donors to view their donations, the lives they've had an impact on, and even a chart that shows their donation progress over the months. Donors will be allowed to create an account on the site, which is how they'll have access to this dashboard, once they donate initially.

What are the benefits?
Well, donors will be more likely to donate , more frequently as well as sometimes with larger sums of money.

So that's our vision so far.

Before I conclude actually, on a sidenote, we initially were considering running a fundraising campaign, but we scrapped this because it only results in more one-off donors, as opposed to the long-term, *organic* donors we were hoping to get.

Okay, so our tech stack consisted of Wordpress which is where Sarthak and I spend most of our time on. The initial designs of the UI and the dashboard were created in Figma by Arsalaan. Wordpress is a natural choice because our NPO uses the same platform to power their current website. This drastically reduces the amount of time and effort needed to implement this solution. Plus, data can easily be imported/exported via the Wordpress backend.

If we're given the opportunity to work with our organization, we'd work on ironing out our existing features + adding a few more, such as a social media shareable link that would allow the user to share the impact they've had on the organization. This would allow others to potentially donate to our organization once they see how little it takes to have an impact. We would also work on the dashboard to dynamically update data from a central database that only our organization has access to. 

Please check out our prototype website. We recently added since Wordpress wasn't allowing us to generate a static site to display on Github, but you can visit it here.

So, that's out project so far. We can now move on to Q and A.

Thank you very much!
