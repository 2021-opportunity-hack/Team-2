Hello and welcome to our submission for the Opportunity Hacks 2021. My name is Jason, and I'm representing my team consisting of Arsalaan and Sarthak. For this hackathon, our NPO was Control Alt Delete, a non-profit that helps faciliate a new lease of life to domestic violence & abused individuals around the Arizona area. The problem they faced was the fact that they struggled to get a steady stream of donations.

Our job was to mitigate this issue by coming up with ways to make donations more tangible.

We thought of multiple solutions for this problem, but we decided to focus our efforts on the one place that potential donors spend the most time on -- the website and we Our solution helps address 2 problems - one, it gets in more donors by making it clear what the NPOs mission is, and how they can help our NPO with a decent amount of money. Two, is that we further incentivize our donor to become more than just a one-off donor by showing them that their donation isn't just gone and locked away in a blackbox forever. It's actually had an impact on many lives.

Our project uses Wordpress on the frontend as well as the backend. This is a natural choice considering that our NPO uses Wordpress to power their site as well, so actually implementing this idea would be much more streamlined.

Okay, now let me demonstrate what we've done to the website. So this is a just a prototype of our actual solution. We would have loved to have worked on many more features, but were limited by the amount we had to spend on this hackathon over the past week. 

Okay, so this is the initial landing page. We've done major UI touchups because there's research that goes into describing that people are put off by a dead, boring-looking website. Not to say that our NPOs site was boring, just that there was so much room for improvement. We've also rearranged certain sections to make it immediately obvious to a potential donor what the NPO's missions is such as this and this. We recognize that many people don't have much time and we want to point out, in the least amount of time as possible, things that will positively tip our donors' decision in our favour.

But this is just one part of a bigger pie. After a person donates a certain amount of money, and they can do this via the credit card or even Paypal, they will get a link to register for an account on the site. Once they do this, they'll get access to a custom dashboard that provides information about how much they've donated over a period of time, and useful metrics that depict how many lives their money has impact on. Our hope is that when donors see this impact, they'd be more likely to donate a larger sum of money. We are trying to harness, not exploit, the basic psychological trait built into each human that pushes us to help more people when we realize how much of help we actually are. It's all about providing the right metrics, and dashboard provides most of them. 

Now currently this is manually generated, but this can easily be generated dynamically for every user by syncing these metrics to the backend Wordpress dashboard that only our NPO will have access to.

So, that's our submission so far. If time had been a little more on our side, we would have added a few more features, and worked on improving the current existing ones. 

Thank you very much.
